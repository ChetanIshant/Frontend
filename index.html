Non-sementic tags: these are the tags, jinhe dekh k pta ni lga skte ki ye kya krta hoga (eg. div, span)

Semantic tags: aise tags jinhe dekh k hi unka matlab smjh aajaye (eg. header, footer, main)
with the help of sementic tags we can write the code in a structured way and in a very good readable form
these tags improve the SEO of a webpage
good user experience
that's why use right tags  
these tags are used to make the webpage more dividable and readable

<header></header> this tag includes the headings of a webpage
<main></main> this tag includes the main part of a webpage
<footer></footer> this tag includes the foot of a webpage(eg. contact info etc)

inside the main tag we will discuss three main tags including:
<section></section> for a section on your webpage/ isme humare webpage me sections divide ho jate h
<artice></artice> for an article on your page
<aside></aside> for content aside main content(ADs): while deploying the webpage this section tells the google that the content in this section is not main content
eg: google ads on any webpage
SEO doesn't read the content inside the aside tag as it will affect the ranking of an webpage

inside the anchod tag:
if we want that when someone wants to open the clickable link in the new tab 
then there we will be using a target keyword in the anchor tag 
eg: <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_main">Google</a>

we can also use an image in place of text for clickable links:
eg: <a href="https://www.google.com" <img src="image link" alt="Google">

in the image tag if we adjust height then width apne app adjust hojati h as per the height
and this is same for adjusting width
